# abalone-dataset-analysis

## Description
Classification is a machine learning process that can be used to predict the class of a given data point. In this project we are going to analyze the data and predict the age of abalone by using Random Forest and Linear Regression.

##Project Goal
As stated at the dataset website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone predicting the age of abalone by physical measurements can be a time-consuming task. The goal of this project is to use the measurement that is easier to obtain to predict the age of abalone.
